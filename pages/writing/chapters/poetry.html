<h2>Follow A Path</h2>
<p>Follow a path that leads nowhere.<br>
 On a heading that doesn’t exist.<br>
 To a place that’s filled with despair. <br>
Within a body of mist. <br>
A place that only you can find.<br>
 A dwelling you cannot share.<br>
 This place you see is in your mind. <br>
So enter if you dare. <br>
If you do I bid a warning. <br>
You will not return. <br>
For all whom you know, will be in mourning. <br>
For the life that you’ll trade in.</p>
 <br>
<br>
<h2>Truly Alone</h2>
I sit, I think, truly alone <br>
No one to talk to, not at home <br>
No one to talk to, not by phone <br>
The walls they shake <br>
The walls they tremble, ready to fall <br>
The very edge.<br>
 Releasing it all. <br>
Releasing the pain, the dark, <br>
The vines of my past.<br>
 I try to fight, <br>
But they wrap me tight. <br>
What to do I just don’t know, <br>
They just won’t let me go. <br>
I sit, I cry, oh how I weep <br>
Please, please God let me sleep. <br>
Escape to a dream where I can be free. <br>
To live a life and be happy.</p>
 <br>
<br>
<h2>Painted Face</h2>
<p>Paint a smile upon your face, <br>
To make it look okay, <br>
Wishing time to speed its pace,<br>
 My life now a shade of grey, <br>
Is it right to feel so hollow,<br>
 So sad and all alone,<br>
 Each day it’s getting harder to swallow, <br>
The taste of food unknown, <br>
I wish for happiness every day,<br>
 Or a friend to talk to, <br>
This pain is leading me astray,<br>
 It’s impossible to break through,<br>
 I wish for death when I’m awake, <br>
And even when I sleep,<br>
 My life is a mistake, <br>
This pain it hurts so deep,<br>
 It’s getting harder now to hide,<br>
 When emotions are so rough, <br>
Would it be easier to let life slide,<br>
 Because holding on is too tough, <br>
I think about it every day, <br>
How peaceful it would be, <br>
To let life slip away, <br>
And hope<br>
 That by reading this<br>
 You agree.</p>
 <br>
<br>
<h2>My Friend</h2>
<p>Here I sit and stare, My mind my only friend, Pulling out my hair, When will all this end, Take a breath of air, Try to transcend, Will it always be there? Unable to befriend,  you don’t even seem to care,  Can you comprehend? Or will you look away and swear,  and no longer be my friend.</p>
 

<h2>Hold It Steady</h2>
<p>Hold your hand out, hold it steady Pull the trigger, now I’m ready Standing waiting, watching your gaze Do it now please, no one is coming I’ll stand my ground, I’m not running No running from you, this, us, me Want to forget my past and be free Hope that one day we’ll be friends Even though our story had the worst of ends Even though I know that it’s too late That you are filled with so much hate Hate for me in you, but none for you in me.</p>
 

<h2>In The End</h2>
<p>Dead inside but yet I smile. These emotions, just compile. Fragile as a clay roof tile. Use my phone but who to dial, Alone, as if on a snow filled isle, So cold, so empty, alone I’ll smile. Smile and cry and hope and pray. I could maybe be free one day, This emptiness could decay, Just. Waste away, Away and fill with something new. Something bright. Something true. Fill me with, a new world view. Till then, I am my only friend. Happiness. I will just pretend, Loneliness, all I really have. 
In the end.</p>
 



<h2>Blue Shark</h2>
<p>It’s the sun you see? I see it too. Its yellow silly, it’s not blue. It’s the sky you see! Over by that tree! Not the sky? Oh my, the sea? Confusing are you, I do not know! Bring me there, let’s see, let’s go!! The cave, oh my, oh no,  it’s far too dark!! They say it’s haunted by  a big blue shark! The shark you saw?? I can’t believe! No no, let’s not go, please? Please Steve?? He’ll tear you limb from limb you’ll suffer! Tear flesh from bone, a nice Steve supper!! Oh thank you, thank you! Now let’s adjourn! Go home where it’s safe and not return!</p>
 


<h2>Fuck Off</h2>
<p>Every time I close my eyes, You are there with all your lies. You act like I’m the one to blame, But alone you put out the flame. Let me go and live my life, No need for another bitter strife. Sick to death of looking back, Life a constant anxiety attack. Soon you’ll come to realize, Just how much of you, I despise. Maybe then you’ll leave me alone, Go somewhere else to atone.</p>
 

<h2>LOST INSIDE YOURSELF</h2>
<p>Crawling through your body in your veins. Wrap you up and tie you down with chains. You’ll never move, never scream out again. Your mind explodes, it can’t take the strain. Lost forever, lost inside yourself, alone. You are the king, sit on your lonely thrown. I beg you now; just go away with the wind. Leave me in my mind, alone and pinned. This is how I want it to end. Watch me now as I ascend.</p>
 
<h2>I AM FEAR</h2>
<p>Throw you on a barren stone cut you up, to die alone Let the wind carry your moan People will know i’m coming home Getting closer, I’m so very near People alone are spreading the fear children crying, drain every tear Out from the shadows I will appear Make my stand I’ll cross the line Take back the land that is rightfully mine</p>
 
<h2>CARRY ME AWAY</h2>
<p>Look at my phone but nothing is there, Is it really a surprise I’ve no one to care? You think we don’t breathe the same air, But this world we live on we do all share, If I was to leave would you even know? You forgot about me a long time ago, Melted me, like the spring does the snow, I’ve walked alone just another John Doe. Travelled along a while till I found a cave, The perfect place to dig my own grave, Before I was done, swept up by a wave, Carried away, the ocean’s newest slave.</p>
 
<h2>Inside A Sick Mind</h2>
<p>Drip drip as it hits the ground, The aftermath and its annoying sound, Yet again the deed is done, Is it bad I think its fun? I’m sick and something’s wrong, The urge it gets too strong, Part of me wants to give it up, Tell my story to the likes of Krupp, I know that one day I’ll be caught, But of this  I fear not. Then the urge to kill will cease, I will finally be at peace.</p>
